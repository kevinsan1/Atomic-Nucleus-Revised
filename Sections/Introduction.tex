In this lab, we studied the radioactive materials Cesium-137 and Strontium-90.  Like all radioactive materials, they have unstable nuclei and decay over time through different particle emissions.  There are three main decay processes: alpha, beta, and gamma.  This lab focuses on beta decay and evaluates the ability of these particles to penetrate through both aluminium and plastic.
