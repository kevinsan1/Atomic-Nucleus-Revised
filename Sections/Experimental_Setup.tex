\section{Experimental Setup} 

% (fold)
\label{sec:experimental_setup} As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:theory}, the decay processes of this experiment include gamma as well as beta particles. But since we would only like to study beta decay, we have to eliminate the detection of gamma particles. This is accomplished using the fact that gamma particles penetrate materials much further than beta particles. By choosing the scintillator in configuration 2, we have a smaller distance over which to absorb and detect radiation. Therefore, this scintillator will detect the beta particles and allow the majority of gamma particles to pass through undetected. 

The calibration of the scintillator is done using the discrete energy value given from Cesium, $E=624.3~\text{eV}$. Table~\ref{tab:calibrationNumbers} shows the values we used to calibrate our system from channel numbers to energy values.  The naive assumption was made that the zero channel corresponds to zero energy because we did not have any other known values like the discrete energy given from $^{137}\text{Cs}$. This possible source of error is addressed in Section~\ref{sec:discussion_conclusion}, Discussion/Conclusion.
