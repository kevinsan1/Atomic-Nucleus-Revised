The peaks of each measurement was recorded in Table~\ref{tab:dataCollected} and Figure~\ref{fig:Figures_aluminumShiftsPlot} and \ref{fig:Figures_plasticShiftsPlot} show the energy distributions from both absorbers while collecting data from $^{137}\text{Cs}$.

	\caption{The peaks also shift towards lower energies for aluminum. In order to normalize their intensities, the data for sheets 4,5, and 6 have a constraint on the maximum number of counts collected.  The numbers 1-6 in the plot above and 1-5,7 in Figure~\ref{fig:Figures_plasticShiftsPlot} represent the number of sheets between the radioactive isotope and the scintillator.}

	\caption{The peak of $^{137}\text{Cs}$ shifts towards lower energies as more absorbers are added.  The system was programmed to run until a set number of counts were collected.  The sum of three spectrums shown above contain: the beta spectrum of max energy $1175.63~\text{keV}$ (5\%), the beta spectrum of max energy $513.93~\text{keV}$ (95\%), and the gaussian distribution with a center at $624.3~\text{keV}$ (10\%).}

\end{table}%(tab:dataCollected)
The electron range, $R(E)$, is interpolated using a linear fit of thickness as a function of energy with the weights $1/\sigma^2$ from Table~\ref{tab:dataCollected}. We fit the function to the equation $R(E)=kE^B$, using a least squares fit.  We used a change of variables to transform our equation into a linear problem,
\begin{align*}
	y = m x + c \\
\ln(R(E)) = y \\
\ln(E) = x \\
\ln(k) = c \\
B = m \\
\end{align*}

 Our chi-squared value is $1.7e-4$ and $\text{N}-2$ is 5.  For a good fit, we want $\chi^2\approx \text{N}-2$.  If $\chi^2 \gg \text{N}-2$, it suggests that we are either using the wrong function or our error bars are too small.  If $\chi^2 \ll \text{N}-2$, it suggests that the data fits so well that maybe our error bars are too large.\cite{garcia2000numerical}  We believe the function fit to our data sufficiently describes the range in this domain, but not outside of it.  The values for $k$ and $B$ of aluminium are obtained are: $k = 453.4 \pm 3.5$ and $B = 1.00 \pm 2.26$.  The values for $k$ and $B$ of plastic are: $k = 458.4 \pm 3.56$ and $B = 0.96 \pm 2.31$.  These error bars are significantly too large, which also agrees with analysis of the chi-squared value.

 $R(E)$ has units of mg/cm$^2$, making the values independent of the absorbing material. Figure~\ref{fig:Figures_R_E_Error_ComparisonFull} and \ref{fig:Figures_R_E_Error_ComparisonFullZoomIn} shows our results compared to two other credible sources\cite{RevModPhys.24.28,nistData}, each with uncertainties around 5\%.
